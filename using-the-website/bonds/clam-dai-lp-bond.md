# CLAM-MAI LP Bond

We introduced a CLAM-MAI LP bond when OtterClam launched. It allows you to trade [CLAM-MAI SLP token](https://app.sushi.com/add/0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F/0x383518188C0C6d7730D91b2c03a03C837814a899) in exchange for discounted CLAM on OtterClam.

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have CLAM-MAI SLP tokens in your wallet. You need to go to Sushiswap and add liquidity for the [CLAM-MAI pool](https://app.sushi.com/add/0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F/0x383518188C0C6d7730D91b2c03a03C837814a899) to get them.

2. Head to the [CLAM-MAI SLP Bond page of the OtterClam website](https://app.otterclam.finance/#/bonds/ohm_dai_lp). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of CLAM-MAI SLP tokens you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the largest amount of CLAM you can buy.

4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the OtterClam contract to spend your CLAM-MAI SLP tokens. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.

# How to buy and stake CLAM

## What is CLAM? <a href="what-is-clam" id="what-is-clam"></a>

OtterClam is an OHM fork on the Polygon network that aims to become **A Reservation Currency Memecoin**. Polygon network is an ethereum layer 2 blockchain. To start interaction with Polygon, you need to get some $MATIC first.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to purchase CLAM from exchanges or other chains.

5. Withdraw MATIC from the exchange you use for your wallet. The wallet address should be the same as the one you have for Ethereum.
6. Swap some $MATIC to **$CLAM**. Attention: Don’t swap all! You should save some $MATIC for future gas fees, 0.1\~1 $MATIC is enough for plenty of transactions.
7. Go to OtterClam webapp [https://app.otterclam.finance/#/stake](https://app.otterclam.finance/#/stake)
8. Approve & Stake all your **$CLAM**s.&#x20;
9. Sit and chill.\

_Note: Your fresh stake CLAM will be in warmup for 2 epochs. **$CLAM** in warmup still earns rebase rewards but you can’t unstake it. After 2 epochs, you can claim your warmup and get sCLAM in your wallet._

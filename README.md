# Introduction

## What is OtterClam?

OtterClam is a decentralized ecosystem that incorporates elements of finance, governance, and NFTs, in the metaverse. These three components correspond to OtterClamâ€™s Treasury, DAO, and Otter Kingdom, respectively.

OtterClam is a DAO-governed community of NFT, DeFi, and Metaverse enthusiasts who value transparency, innovation, education, and fun.&#x20;

## What is the goal?

Our goal is to create an ecosystem built on the CLAM token that incorporates NFTs and DeFi in the Metaverse. The ecosystem can be described as a series of overlapping incentives encouraging  users to purchase and hold CLAM via staking, bonding, or locking up PEARLs in chests in order to receive rewards.

&#x20;The treasury backing CLAM is DAO-governed and optimized to support the interests of the community. Currently, under the directives of the DAO, the treasury funds are being utilized to optimize growth by diversifying assets. The "Treasury" in the Otter Kingdom is not simply a multi-sig wallet that maintains the protocol's funds.&#x20;

We've broadened the Treasury's working definition to include the all the mechanisms at work behind the protocol's reward system. These include NFT market revenue management, the PEARL chests/notes rewards system, and of course, the various staking and bonding features that serve as the backbone of the protocol.

Users might also be introduced to our project through PAW Market, a proprietary, Polygon-based NFT market where users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs without the high fees associated with the Ethereum network.&#x20;

Since PAW Market will be open source and permissionless, in addition to being far more cost-effective than other platforms, we're confident this feature of the Otter Kingdom will attract many users while supporting the exponential growth of Polygon's NFT ecosystem.&#x20;

PAW Market will utilize the CLAM token at every turn. Buying, selling, and minting NFTs will require CLAM. This will support the treasury's growth directly, and the OtterClam protocol more broadly, by creating a source of natural demand.&#x20;

We believe that once users interact with any individual aspect of the protocol, the intra-protocol incentive structure will encourage continued engagement and organic growth. It is not unreasonable, in other words, to imagine a user coming from a DeFi-centric platform seeing value in the NFT platform.

&#x20;Furthermore, we hope some of our NFT enthusiasts take the time to learn more about the inner workings of our DeFi infrastructure. If we have done our job well, the OtterClam applications, with the help of our friendly community, will support the educational efforts we've established to ensure users have access to the information they need to make the right decision, the first time.

Finally, we want to make interactions with our protocol seamless, educational, and fun. We understand the complexity of a DeFi protocol can be overwhelming, so as with any organization that prioritizes user friendliness, we strive to minimize users' exposure to complexity while emphasizing simplicity and functionality.&#x20;

## How can I benefit from OtterClam?

We have created several ways to benefit from the OtterClam ecosystem. There are many different paths a fellow Otter can take to earn CLAM. Several of these have already been mentioned.

The main benefit for stakers comes from stable supply growth. Otters harvest new CLAM tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers thanks to the CLAM tokens they offered. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in CLAM and thus the bonder's profit would depend on CLAM price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static CLAM price.

## Who created OtterClam?

Our team is mostly anonymous, born from the habitat of otters.&#x20;

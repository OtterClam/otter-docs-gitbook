# Introduction

## What is OtterClam?

[**OtterClam**](https://www.otterclam.finance) is the first decentralized reserve memecoin protocol on **Polygon Network** based on the **CLAM** token. Each **CLAM** token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. MAI/QUICK/MATIC) in the Otter's treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. OtterClam also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding.

OtterClam is a fork of [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance) on Polygon network.

## What is the point of OtterClam?

Most memecoins do not have any tokenomics built inside. Investors will suffer from large volatility and have a significant chance toward zero. The Otter King (or the world?) noticed that the OlympusDAO creates the strongest tokenomics of the DeFi world. We decide to bring the bonding and protocol-owned liquidity to the otter’s kingdom!

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled memecoin system, in which the behavior of the **CLAM** token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that **CLAM** can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange _memecoin_. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

## How do I join the Otter family?

There are two main ways for otter lovers: [staking](basics/staking.md) and [bonding](basics/bonding/). Stakers stake their **CLAM** tokens to otters in return for more **CLAM** tokens, while bonders provide LP or MAI tokens in exchange for discounted **CLAM** tokens after a fixed vesting period.

## How can I benefit from OtterClam?

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The otter harvests new **CLAM** tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers thanks for the **CLAM** tokens they offered. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in **CLAM** and thus the bonder's profit would depend on **CLAM** price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static **CLAM** price.

## Who created OtterClam?

OtterClam is a fork of OlympusDAO on the Polygon Network. Our team is mostly anonymous, born from the habitat of otters. We aim at becoming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

## Who runs OtterClam?

Currently, most of the decisions are taken by the core team, but we expect to be able to turn this into a DAO-governed model as soon as possible!
